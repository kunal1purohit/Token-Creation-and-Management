This README explains the MyAdvancedTokenContract, a Soroban smart contract designed for creating and managing custom tokens on the Stellar network.

This contract allows users to:

Create new fungible or non-fungible tokens with a specified name, symbol, total supply, and optional metadata.

Issue new tokens (for fungible tokens only) up to the predefined total supply.

Retrieve the balance of a specific account for a particular token.

Key Features:

Flexible Token Types: Supports both fungible tokens (divisible) and non-fungible tokens (unique).

Issuance Control: Only authorized issuers can create and issue tokens.

Security Measures: Includes checks for existing tokens, total supply limits, and issuer permissions.

Optional KYC: Allows enabling KYC requirements for specific tokens (concept for future implementation).

Tech Stack

Soroban: The smart contract language for the Stellar network, used to write the contract logic.
Rust: The underlying programming language powering Soroban.


Things to Consider

Authorization: Only authorized issuers can create tokens. Ensure proper permissions are in place.

Unique Symbols: Verify that chosen token symbols are unique to avoid conflicts.

Immutable Properties: Total supply and decimals (for fungible tokens) cannot be changed after creation.

KYC (Future Implementation): Enabling KYC requires additional development and integration.

Imagine This...

College Club Tokens: Create a unique token for your college club, allowing for membership fees or event participation.

Community Currencies: Develop a community-specific token to facilitate transactions within a closed ecosystem.

Digital Collectibles: (Concept) Issue non-fungible tokens to represent unique digital collectibles.

Disclaimer: This is an educational project. Before deploying real-world tokens, thoroughly understand relevant regulations and legal requirements.

Getting Started

This is a high-level overview. Refer to the contract code for detailed implementation and functions. The code utilizes Soroban syntax and libraries.
